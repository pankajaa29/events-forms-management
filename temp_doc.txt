Requirements For – Intelligent Forms Management System
1. Objective
Build an endtoend Forms Management System comparable to Google Forms but significantly more powerful, with advanced question types, deep conditional logic, branding, data exports, and a GenAI–assisted intelligence layer. The system must be enterpriseready, deterministic at core, and AIaugmented (not AIdependent).
2. Core Principles
	•	Deterministic form engine (no AI in submission logic)
	•	AI as assistive, advisory, and insightgenerating
	•	Fully configurable by form owner

I want to follow LEGO blocks approach 
Below is a micro-goal–based execution plan, end to end, covering Frontend (React), Backend (Django), Database, and Hosting. I want each goal to be small, testable, and dependency-aware.
Tech Stack Decisions (Locked)

	•	Django Admin for internal ops
Database (Call taken)- PostgreSQL (SQL)
Hosting - AWS 
Firebase later for analytics or auth if needed
